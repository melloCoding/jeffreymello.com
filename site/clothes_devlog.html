            So in this first version of the game I created some basic art for the game. 
            Starting off with the player art which I decided I wanted to make a wizard. 
            Then I imported the the player art into godot and started creating the assests I would need for player movement. 
            Then we had movement!!! Next step was to import the sprite sheets from my pixel art program, and get them working. 
            Once I got the animations playing it was just a simple matter of adding the code to the player script to controll animations. 
            Next it was time to make a tile set to work with. I hopped into Aseprite and started designing the tileset. (add picture)

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: 3.5em;" class="roboto">
            After I drew the tileset I then worked on importing it into godot, and after some work ,adding collsions and such, I was succesfull. 
            Using the newly created tileset I then created a test level to futher test movement and animations. 
            I then set my attention to the main mechanic of the game the clothes spreading. 
            This mechanic currently isnt working given it is shockingly difficult to have an object duplicate itself. 
            But nonetheless the closthes still render if a little big but do not do anything yet. 
            You can play a working web build at the link below.
